## deploy-to-azure-button

This repo shows the experience of deploying an ARM template via a click of a button.

## ARM templates are deployed, not BICEP

Although BICEP is now the preferred way of creating Azure deployments as code (Infrastructure as Code or IaC), the ARM templates built from BICEP are actually deployed.

## Deployment by Button

Hit this button to deploy the ARM template as seen in this repository:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fingrammicrocloudde%2Fazure-fundamentals%2Fmain%2Fbasicvm.json)

Just log in to the Azure portal and deploy.
